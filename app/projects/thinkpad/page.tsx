                Growing up, I was fascinated by computers, beginning with an old
                Acer desktop that struggled to run even basic games like
                Maplestory. After years of request, I was first exposed to PC
                building when my mom enlisted a friend&apos;s help to assemble a
                computer from spare parts. I remember thinking how cool it was
                at that time.
                <br />
                <br />
                Fast forward to today, I recently rediscovered my passion and
                transitioned into computer science. Rather than building a
                desktop, I wanted to try my hand at modding a
                laptopâ€”specifically a ThinkPadâ€”due to its affordability,
                portability, and strong community support.

                I purchased my ThinkPad T440p through ebay for a decent price.
                At the time of writing (March 2025) the CAD has been pretty
                weak, so I was pretty happy with being able to get a pristene
                model for $159CAD. The initial spec sheet:
